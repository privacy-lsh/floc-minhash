# Locality-Sensitive Hashing Does Not Guarantee Privacy! <br> Attacks on Google's FLoC and the MinHash Hierarchy

This repository contains the code for the reproduction of privacy systems based on LSH 
and our attacks, breaking the privacy properties of those systems, along with their experimental evaluation on real datasets.

from the paper "Locality-Sensitive Hashing Does Not Guarantee Privacy! Attacks on Google's FLoC and the MinHash Hierarchy"

Our work focuses on two popular functions from the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) family, namely SimHash and MinHash.
Both are used in Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) and the MinHash Hierarchy system respectively.
